# AnyIcon: type and class icons utility

![Addon's icon](/icon.svg)

A singleton providing easy access to icons representing classes and types, from values or members.

This is **not** a GUI, it's a GDScript utility. If you look for a GUI to 
look up editor icons, you may want to use
[Godot Editor Theme Explorer](https://github.com/YuriSizov/godot-editor-theme-explorer).



## Features / How to use

The addon is only made of one static class called
[AnyIcon](addons/any_icon.editor/any_icon.gd).
It provides easy access to icons representing the type of a value or the type
expected by the member of an Object.

Most methods accept an optional `fallback` parameter,
which is the name of the icon that will be fetched from the `"EditorIcons"`
theme type in case no icon is found for a type
(this is very unlikely to happen since all types are covered and classes
will at least inherit `Object` and thus it's icon)

You can look at the documentation generated by Godot for more information.
(By default: `F1` then search for `AnyIcon`.)



### Getting the icon for the expected type of the member of an Object

There are a few methods providing icons for the type of members, such as
`get_property_icon(object: Object, property_name: StringName, fallback: StringName = &"")`.



### Getting the icon for the type of a value

The main method provided by [AnyIcon](addons/any_icon.editor/any_icon.gd)
is `get_variant_icon(any_value: Variant)`. It's a static method that returns
the icon associated with the passed value. It can handle any value, from built-in
types (bool, int, Packed\*Array), to custom classes with `@icon("path")` specified.

There are more specific methods that you can use if you already know if the value
you pass is a built-in type, a built-in class, or a custom class.



## Installation

You can download the addon:
- On GitHub: `Code` → `Download ZIP`.
- Through the editor: `AssetLib` → Search for "AnyIcon"

You can exclude `*.editor/*` or `any_icon.editor/` from your export presets
because this addon is editor-only.

## Godot version

Note: In 4.3, there will be a few warnings at installation due to script UIDs that were introduced in 4.4.

Won't work with 4.2 due to missing methods required by this addon.

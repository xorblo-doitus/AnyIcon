# AnyIcon: type and class icons utility

![Addon's icon](/icon.svg)

A utility singleton providing an easy way to get the icon of any value (Node, custom class, bool, int...)

This is **not** a GUI, it's a GDScript utility. If you look for a GUI to 
look up editor icons, you may want to use
[Godot Editor Theme Explorer](https://github.com/YuriSizov/godot-editor-theme-explorer).



## Features / How to use

The main method provided by [AnyIcon](addons/class_icons.editor/class_icons.gd)
is `get_variant_icon(any_value: Variant)`. It's a static method that returns
the icon associated with the passed value. It can handle any value, from builtin
types (bool, int, Packed\*Array), to custom classes with `@icon("path")` specified.

There are more specific methods too, that you can use if you already know if the value
you pass is a builtin type, a builtin class or a custom class.

Every method accepts an optional `fallback` parameter,
which is the name of the icon that will be fetched from the `"EditorIcons"`
theme type in case no icon is found for a type
(this is very unlikely to happen, since all types are covered and classes
will at least inherit `Object` and thus it's icon)

You can look at the documentation generated by Godot for more infromations.
(By default: `F1` then search for `AnyIcon`.)



## Installation

You can download the addon:
- On GitHub: `Code` → `Download ZIP`.
- Through the editor: `AssetLib` → Search for "AnyIcon"

You can exclude `*.editor/*` or `class_icons.editor/` from your export presets,
because this addon is editor-only.


## Examples

I will soon use this utility in [TileSet Clipboard](https://github.com/xorblo-doitus/TileSet-Clipboard/) and [BBCodeEdit](https://github.com/xorblo-doitus/BBCodeEdit). (In fact this addon is a refactor of a script from BBCodeEdit, so you can already look at how it's used here)
